                            <h2>PhD Topic And Proposal Help</h2>
                            <p>This stage is the first step taken towards doing your actual PhD research. Before formulating a research topic, you need to be clear about your thoughts and ideas so that they may be summarised in the form of  topic suggestion document.</p>
                            <h2>Selecting a right topic of your research – Why is it important?</h2>
                            <p>Too ambitious a topic can lead to delays in completing your research work and also require external funds to complete. Too easy a topic of research may lead to rejections when conducting your research or even can become difficult to defend when committee asks for unique contribution of your research.</p>
                             <h2>An appropriate topic leads to a good PhD Proposal or Synopsis</h2>
                            <p>If the topic is selected without collecting enough scientific evidence or journal papers, the resulting PhD proposal or synopsis will also have no impact. This will lead to rejections and poor structure of research.</p>
                            <h2>Topic Selection – 3 tips to follow</h2>
                            <p>These three tips will ensure that you do not select any topic but select a research topic which is challenging yet viable to complete in stipulated time.</p>
                            <p><br>🅐Look for minimum 10 references which relate to your research topic however, do not exactly address your problem statement. Mention this as your source for selection of topic.

                           <br> 🅑Google your topic and search specifically on ResearchGate, Google Scholar to ensure that there is no direct match of your topic.

                       <br>🅒 Do not try to include a lot of aspects of your research in your topic. Topic is a brief statement of your title of research.</p>

                            <h2>PhD Literature Review Writing Help</h2>
                            <p>Developing a critical literature review for your PhD thesis is critical to establishing a correct research gap and thereby selecting correct research objectives. PhD Guidance provides complete assistance from searching for relevant sources/citations for literature review and also writing the chapter. Presented below are some steps on how to develop a literature review</p>
                            <h3>Find A Topic</h3>
                            <p>When you need to review literature for your thesis, it is important to find a topic first. This can be done while searching the existing literature. When you know the amount and relevance of your searched literature, you may tweak your topic by modifying or narrowing it down.</p>
                            <h3>Locate And Review Literature</h3>
                            <p>In this step, you should do a generic reading of your searched literature. This helps you in understanding more about the already covered topics, but also about those that have the scope of further investigation. You may also go through the linked theories and models that can be the basis of detailed research.</p>
                            <h3>Establish The Writing Purpose</h3>
                            <p>Identify the aim of writing a literature review. Most of the times, it is about tracing ethical, legal and political issues and other historical developments. You may also need this for judging the effectiveness of treatment or identifying the existing gaps in research.</p>
                            <h3>Evaluate Literature</h3>
                            <p>To give due importance to critical and relevant results in your study, it is also essential to interpret and evaluate literature. When you discuss about your study topic, it is important to develop your discussion based on literature that is built on relevant theories.</p>
                            <h3>Do Literature Synthesis</h3>
                            <p>Based on your study’s design, framework and research model, it is required to synthesize your literature or group it. If there are any noticeable cracks, then those can be used to explore the research gap.</p>
                            <h3>Develop The First Draft</h3>
                            <p>When you start writing the initial draft of your literature review, make sure you form meaningful headings and subheadings. Use your preferred or recommended professional citation style in a consistent manner. All relevant theories should also be developed properly.</p>
                            <h3>Peer Review The Draft</h3>
                            <p>After you prepare the first draft, get it peer-reviewed to remove plagiarism and unnoticed errors. Based on the peer review feedback, make appropriate changes to shape your work well.</p>

                            <h2>PhD Research Methodology Chapter Help</h2>
                            <p>Research methodology is the basis of your study. You should have an intensive knowledge of all aspects of research, while you are writing it. You need to execute your ideas with precision to develop it well. While many research students think about their data collection tools when they start writing about the methodology, it is also important to look at some other aspects according to Saunders.</p>
                            <h3>Some important points to be noted in this concept include the following</h3>
                            <p>The type of reality you have been investigating triggers some beliefs. The set of such beliefs is termed as the research philosophy. Its assumptions actually justify your methodology.</p>
                            <p>Research philosophy can be categorized in three ways ontology, epistemology and axiology on the basis of your understanding. Each of the thought processes differs in the approach you adopt toward the understanding of your methodology.</p>
                            <p>The philosophy of positivism assumes that reality is independent of subjects, the philosophy of constructivism assumes that observations are interpreted based on subjects’ response differences.</p>
                            <p>The deductive approach of research is regarding the deduction of hypotheses from theories, making them operational, and testing them. On the other hand, the inductive approach is regarding the building up of theories based on people’s ways of interpreting certain events.</p>
                            <p>Based on your research topic and its intrinsic qualities, the choice between primary and secondary data or between qualitative and quantitative research is made. When there are specific queries and their contexts, answers are sought through a mixed kind of methodology.</p>
                            <p>The Research methodology chapter will cover Developing a research design, it is done once the scholar is aware of the research gap, Developing a questionnaire, it’s done when objectives are made, Reliability test or Pilot Study is done by collecting some samples(30-40), Data collection is done on the basis of questionnaire developed, Data analysis is a descriptive and factor analysis or SEM.</p>

                            <h2>Questionnaire Design For PhD Research</h2>
                            <p>The key objective of a questionnaire is provide standardised interview across all subjects. This is so that all respondents are asked the questions that are appropriate to them, and so that, when those questions are asked, they are always asked in exactly the same way.</p>
                            <h3>Points to Ponder When Designing a Questionnaire</h3>
                            <p><br>☞Data Collection Media
                          <br> ☞ Types of Question and Data
                      <br>  ☞Application of scales in measurement
                <br>  ☞Ethical issues involved
              <br>  ☞Writing and laying the format of Questionnaire</p>
                            <h3>Why design your questionnaire with us?</h3>
                            <p>☞Questionnaire design is one of the most crucial aspects of your academic research. It is never similar to writing a chapter or conducting analysis. You must have a sound knowledge of statistics and should bear in mind the hypothesis to develop questions which can be directly attributed to them.
                           <br> ☞Choice of scales like Likert five point or seven point scale is also important and should be backed by rationale for using the same.
                      <br> ☞ Our team can assist you in developing a questionnaire for research and pilot study. Our experienced team members have already helped numerous doctoral candidates in the same.

                            <p>When you perform qualitative research, you mostly study the context of a problem and the involved issues in order to find answers to your research problem. Qualitative research generally uses techniques, such as observation and personal interviews, to answer questions. It requires you to study the behavior of participants for assessing the causes of certain events and actions displayed by them. Qualitative approach varies significantly from quantitative in the sense that it investigates the ‘how and why’ of things.</p>
                            <h3>Why Choose a Qualitative Study?</h3>
                            <p>
Through a qualitative study, you can understand an unknown phenomenon and find out its causes. Several causal explanations in ethnographic research are now provided through such qualitative studies. This approach is adopted by a range of studies performed in the field of social sciences, including grounded theory studies. Ranging from content analysis and the study of journals to taking field notes, there are several methods of data collection used by qualitative studies.

As a researcher, you can attain recognition through publishing research papers in reputed journals. However, the path to publication is not easy. Publishing in any impact factor journals requires author to do original research, write as per journal standards and patience. A lot of researchers have novelty in their topic but still are unable to get themselves published.</p>

</h2>
                            <p>The submission of your final research thesis is not the end of your project. Your review committee goes through your work thoroughly and offers its feedback. Sometimes, you not just receive their viewpoints, but also receive additional comments to improve your report. However, you do not need to get disheartened, as we are always there to help you incorporate this feedback rightly into your report. We help you address the received comments after you discuss these with your supervisor.</p>
                            <h3>What you need to do?</h3>
                            <p>
You only need to share the entire feedback with us so we can review the comments in the light of your submitted thesis. Based on our review, we design an apt strategy to incorporate the required alterations. If your thesis/dissertation chapters need any justified changes, then we make sure to revise these chapters. However, we do not do that without assessing the impact of these changes.

                            <h2>Systematic Literature Review
</h2>
                            <p>Systematic Literature Review (SLR) can be seen as a step ahead taken in literature review. It also searches, identifies, selects and then analyses the existing literature to answer the questions raised in the current research work. However, the critical approach is enhanced in a systematic approach to fulfill the purpose of providing better credibility and clarity. This rigorous process does not just involve finding the accurate literature for the study but also strategically planning the methods of collecting those studies. The criteria and approach of your study also remain the focal point while conducting the SLR, as it is done with the purpose to improve the existing knowledge about the discoveries in the topic area, to evaluate the research methodologies that have been used earlier and to come up with better theories and analysis.</p>

</h2>
                            <p>PhD Synopsis or Thesis Proposal is considered to be the most important step for the development of a successful thesis because if it gets rejected, you can’t move on to the process of developing a thesis. Therefore, it becomes crucial to prepare a synopsis that highlights the significance of your proposed research work. Along with the research topic and title, the synopsis must include a brief introduction, scope and purpose of the research, the chosen research methodology, presentation of the findings in support of your research, questions which will be answered, time needed for the research and appropriate resource citations to show the credibility of your research.</p>

                            <h2>Conceptual Framework Design
</h2>
                            <p>Conceptual Framework or Research Framework can be defined as the illustrations which are used to highlight the important variables which show the findings from the research. Most of the time, these frameworks are based on the literature review of the research. It most importantly shows the cause and effect relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This simple structure can become trickier with a large number of variables affecting the data and when there are other variables like moderating variables, mediating variables and controlling variables. Therefore, it becomes important to draw a conceptual framework in an illustrated graphic for a better clarity.</p>
                            <h3>Benefits of Conceptual Framework</h3>
                            <p>👍The visual framework of research can be used for both theoretical and statistical research methodologies.

                          <br> 👍 It helps in visualising the plan and strategizing process of the research as well.
                     <br>  👍 Science and Biotechnology
                 <br>  👍 It also helps in providing a conceptual structure to the research so that it does not divert from its purpose.
              <br> 👍 It simplifies the process of critically analysis and understanding the research topic for your peers and advisors.</p>
